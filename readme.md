# RNDM Environment Installation Tool (BETA)

## About

This Application is designed to take you through most of the setup in a fresh environment in order to begin developing React Native Applications on iOS, Android, Apple TV, Android TV and Web on a macOS Platform. The steps for generating this have come from the following article:

This is still a BETA application and has not been rigorously tested against multiple environments. The hope is to eventually create a tool that can be deployed across a variety of platforms (specifically macOS, Windows and other major distributions) with differing levels of pre-setup to allow developers to begin developing in the shortest timeframe possible.

**Recommended:** Before you actually use this tool, we fully recommend that you test-run it in a sandbox enviroment such as with a virtual machine. This is to prevent any harmful and untested code from corrupting your existing system.

We fully welcome any and all suggestions and pull requests to enable this vision! If you are an expert in platform or environment setup using languages such as JavaScript, Bash, Ruby, Python or any other cross platform technology, please get in touch.

Thanks! RNDM Team.
